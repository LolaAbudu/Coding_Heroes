    <string name="lola_aboutMe_textview_description">Migrating from Nigeria to United States at the young age of 11, I was forced to adapt to a completely new way of life. Being raised by a single mother of three has taught me a lot about hard work, dedication and perseverance. After obtaining my Bachelor in Psychology and unable to find employment, I decided to become an Emergency Medical Technician. Unfortunately 2 years later, I got injured at the job and could no longer perform the necessary tasks required on the job. About a week after the injury, I found out I was pregnant. Feeling down and unsure of where to go next, I decided to join the workforce. My original plan was to simply find another healthcare job position in which I could somehow utilize my experiences and skills that I had already acquired. Sometimes we are unaware of what direction God chooses to take us and what path he uses to get us there. One day out the blue, I received an email from workforce about a program called Bridge-To-Tech. This program preps students for Tech Bootcamps. Never having done any form of coding, I decided to apply. Fortunately I got accepted and suddenly I realized how much I enjoyed coding. After the 2 month prep, I applied to Pursuit (formerly C4Q) and got accepted. Hence here I am now pursuing something that can potentially change the course of my future for the better. Being a woman and a minority, I would love to bridge that gap and have the opportunity to inspire others who are in my shoes. In conclusion, I would like to say, trust the process of your life and where it takes you. Things that seem like it was meant to break you can be simply be your blessings in disguise.</string>
